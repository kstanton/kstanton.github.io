<h3><i>Brentwood Shops Announce Annual Christmas Crawl</i></h3>


<p><b>Brentwood, TN -</b> Locally owned Brentwood shops are pleased to announce the 11th annual Brentwood Christmas Crawl. The event will be held November 7th, 8th and 9th at nine local Brentwood shops in the business district of Brentwood proper. </p>

<p>The nine participating stores include Aly + Sy, Copper Penny, Cosmetic Market, Hot Pink, Maxi B. Home, Pear Tree Avenue, Snooty Fox, Spruce and Vignette. On Thursday, November 7th, all nine shops will be open from 10 a.m. until 7 p.m. On Friday and Saturday the stores will be open during their normal hours. </p>

<p>"We are all very excited for another exciting Christmas Crawl," Alicia Helm, organizer of the Brentwood Christmas Crawl and owner of Spruce says. "It's a fun event every year for everyone involved and we can't wait to welcome shoppers ahead of the Christmas season!" </p>

<p>Prizes include a $500 gift card to the shop of the winner’s choice. The contest can be entered by picking up an entry card at any of the participating retailers, getting the card stamped by each participating store and leaving it at the last shop visited.  Once the crawl is over, a random drawing will be held. Participants who collected all nine stamps will be eligible to win the $500 gift card. Participants who collect at least six of the nine stamps will be eligible to win other prizes as well.</p>
