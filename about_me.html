	<h2>About Myself</h2>
	<img src="img/Kate_Stanton.jpg" alt="Kate Stanton Headshot" class="noprint" />
	<p>My passion has always been creating things and when I decided to take a Television Production class my freshman year of high school, I found a place to put that passion. Now I am a Junior at the University of Miami looking to complete my Electronic Media Production and Economics double major along with my Sports Administration minor by May 2015. I dabble in all things creative and have acquired skills in creating videos, images and animations during my time at Miami. My dream is to go into news and work my way up to be a producer someday. If you want to know more feel free to <a href="contact.html" id="contact">contact me</a>.</p>
