	<h2>About Myself</h2>
	<img src="img/Kate_Stanton.jpg" alt="Kate Stanton Headshot" class="noprint" />
	<p>My passion has always been creating things and when I decided to take a Television Production class my freshman year of high school, I found a place to put that passion. As of May 2015, I have graduated from the University of Miami with a double major in Electronic Media Production and Economics along with a Sports Administration minor. I dabble in all things creative and have acquired skills in creating videos, images and animations during my time at Miami. My dream is to go into news and work my way up to be a producer.
