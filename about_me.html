	<p> I am an Emmy nominated news producer with four years of experience in local news. I spent a year in Saginaw, Michigan (Market #76) at WNEM where I started by producing the noon newscast and weekend mornings. I then moved to prdocuing The Morning News, Monday through Friday. In the summer of 2016 I took a job with WHNS in Greenville, SC (Market #37) where I now produce the  #1 late news in the market, The Ten O'Clock News. Our Show was nominated for "Best Newscast" in the 2018 and 2019 Southeastern Emmy's.

		My passion has always been creating things and when I decided to take a Television Production class my freshman year of high school, I found a place to put that passion. I graduated from the University of Miami in May 2015 with a double major in Electronic Media Production and Economics along with a Sports Administration minor. I dabble in all things creative and have acquired skills in creating videos, images and animations over the years.
