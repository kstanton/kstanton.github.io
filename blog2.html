<h2>'Knesset’s reflection of Israel as Jewish state</h2>
<p>Looking down from the VIP visitor gallery in Plenum Hall, one sees the section where members of the Knesset and government officials discuss and debate issues and legislation.</p>

<p>Our Knesset tour guide, Lili Peragameinkov, explained the seating assignments in the large hall. For example, by custom, the parliamentary group with the most members (currently the Likud Party), gets to select first where its members will sit.   The center table, which is shaped like a horseshoe, is for  government members. The prime minister, Bejamin Netanyahu, sits at the center of the head table.</p>

<p>Then Lili asked us to look closely at how the 116 seats for the Knesset members are arranged.  The officials’ dark wooden desks create a pattern of a menorah, she said, which is not initially apparent.</p>

<p>Upon the founding of the state of Israel, the menorah was chosen as the state’s official symbol. A bronze, 15-foot –high menorah also can be found across from the Knesset gates.</p>

<p>That the menorah, which symbolizes the eternity of the Jewish people, is used so prominently in a government building sends a clear statement: Israel is a Jewish state.</p>

<p>As I walked around the Knesset, I continued to notice aspects of the Jewish religion inserted into all aspects of the building. The mosaics and tapestries on the wall all depicted scenes that are well recognized in the Jewish religion.</p>

<p>The integration of religion and state is apparent in Israel, even though the question of what it means to be a Jewish state remains controversial.</p>

<p>Israel exists in a land that many other groups connect to religiously.  Their churches and mosques are here, as are their people. This being said, with the country identifying itself as a Jewish state, is there room or tolerance for others? After taking a walk through the Knesset that is certainly a question.</p>
