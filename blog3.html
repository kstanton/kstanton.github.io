<h2>The new Ten Commandments</h2>

<p>Picture the helpless child in the Polish ghetto with his hands above his head against the Nazis. There is nothing he can do to prevent the Nazis from deciding his fate. This is one of many of the examples Professor Gad Yair used to help explain his theory on the Israeli Existential Anxiety. This theory includes what he calls “The Ten Commandments” which consists of rules that are the nature of the Israeli culture. </p>

<p>What made this interesting was not only how much their culture differed from American culture but also how little you hear about this viewpoint in America. He went into great detail as to how the personalities of Israelis affect their policy making and general attitude towards the world. </p>

<p>One of the larger points the Israelis don’t want to be a “freier,” which translates into a sucker. They do whatever they can to make sure no one cheats them and will make sure they get the first punch in if they believe there is a threat.</p>

<p>What he attributes this attitude to goes back to the Holocaust and the mindset that they will make sure they will “never again be cheated.” </p>

<p>I find these are interesting concepts to wrap my mind around as I can definitely see how they might make decisions a little differently because of this. I find that in the United States I have never been exposed to how different of a mindset people in Israel are.</p>
