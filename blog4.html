<h2>Why the Israel and Palestine conflict will not end anytime soon</h2>

	<p>The news of the continuous conflict between the Israelis and Palestinians is white noise to the world these days. While everyone looking in from the outside is hopeful that a resolution will come, the people that are directly involved have a different opinion.</p>
	
	<p>Being thrown into a simulation created by The Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya, a private university in Israel, my eyes were opened to the issues surrounding the conflict. I was told that I was one of two people acting as the United States and was to mediate a discussion between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. </p>

	<p>I can’t say that I thought it would be easy considering if I have learned anything in my last two weeks it’s that the problems surrounding the conflict are a lot more complicated then they appear to be.</p>

	<p>The simulation stretched my knowledge though as I was presented with two sides that refused to give anything without proof that the other wouldn’t break their promises. </p>

	<p>On top of this, I found that as soon as we would try to approach one problem ten more appeared (when I pointed this out I was promptly told “welcome to Israel”).</p>

	<p>To make a long story short, we were unable to come to a solution, which just added to my growing belief that this conflict is not going to be solved in the near future. </p>

	<p>With a number of speakers, all with varying opinions, coming in to talk to us recently all have come to a similar conclusion. Some list different things that will need to be done in order for peace to occur, all think it’s going to take quite a bit of time. </p>

	<p>Most of these opinions identified the root of the problem though; the mindsets of the Israelis and the Palestinians don’t acquiesce. </p>

	<p>There is too much history involved that neither side is willing to forget. While some consider it self-defeating to hold onto the past so dearly there is no way that it can be justified to ask either side to do this. </p>
	
	<p>The fact of the matter is that this is how it is and neither side sees it as something that can be resolved. Until they see a way to move forward, history and all, the friction between the two entities is not going to change.</p>
