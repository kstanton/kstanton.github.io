<h2>Economics at the 5th Presidential Conference</h2>

<p>The moderator Mr. Guy Rolnick from Israel commented in the beginning of the panel session panel Economic Principles vs. Social Values: Harmony or Conflict  that he was overwhelmed with how many people were there. <p>

<p>“We were expecting just a conversation among friends like in years past,” he explained. </p>

<p>This statement showed how much the conference has grown within the last five years. I was pleased to know how much it had grown as the conference is a wealth of information and discusses many important issues.</p>  

<p>Sitting in my first panel of the day at the fifth Israeli Presidential Conference I was not prepared for the wealth of information I was about to learn from the five panelists who sat along a table in the front of the room.</p>

<p>Many influential people in the field discussed in detail everything from the wealth gap to the influence of changing social values on the economy.</p>

<p>One of the main points in the panel Economic Principles vs. Social Values: Harmony or Conflict that was repeatedly made is that the younger generations are changing the current economic system. In the words of Sir Ronald Cohen from the UK</p>

<p>“There’s a generation now that wants to do social things along with be profitable.”</p>

<p>Moving on from the topic of just the younger generation the panelists looked into the rising wealth gap that is affecting everyone and why it cannot continue to grow as rapidly as it is today. Manuel Trajtenberg from Israel explained that</p>

<p>“the greatest challenge is to provide answers because the people are not going to stand for it.”</p>

<p>These just being small snapshots of an overwhelmingly informative conference show how important it is to have these in order to get these ideas into one place.</p>

<p>The fact that the conference is growing larger every year is great to see as it provides a tool for people from everywhere in the world to understand what is going on. </p>

<p>The conference was an extraordinary opportunity to learn more about the growing issues of the world and specifically for me to hear professionals in the field of economics compare their ideas on widely debated issues in the world today. </p>
